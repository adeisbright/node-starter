Learning Node.js 
================ 
Node.js is an open source and cross platform javascript runtime environment 
for writing server side applications , command line tools , and other types 
of application that can run outside the browser.
It runs a Google V8 engine. 
A node app is run on a single process without creating new threads for every request.
It provides a set of non-blocking I/O standard libraries. 
Node libraries are also written using a non-blocking format. 
When node performs an I/O operation like reading from the file system , communicating 
with a database over a network , instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU 
cycles waiting , node will resume the operation when the response comes back.

This allows node to handle thousands of concurrent connections  with a single 
server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency , which could be a significant 
source of bugs. 

People love node because of the following :
Front end engineers can move to back end easily , alot of useful libraries 
To learn Node.js  , you should know the following javascript : 
Lexical Structure
Expressions
Types
Variables
Functions
this
Arrow Functions
Loops
Scopes
Arrays
Template Literals
Semicolons
Strict Mode
ECMAScript 6, 2016, 2017
Asynchronous programming and Modular programming is essential to node.js 
Asynchronous programming and callbacks
Timers
Promises
Async and Await
Closures
The Event Loop

Stating the difference between Javascript in the browser and Javascript in node 
1. You control the environment in node unlike the browser where you don;t have control 
2. You can use any of the javascript features 
3. You have access to alot of APIs 
4. Document and window is not available in node.js 
V8 is the engine that powers javascript in Googles chrome browser. It is fast and highly performant

Modern Javascript engine don't just interpret javascript , they compile it.
Compiling javascript code makes it faster . V8 uses a Just in Time Compilation

To run nodejs from the command line :
Move into your project directory , and run node filename.js (node is a globally available command) 

To exit from a running program , just press CTRL + C 
How to use node.js REPL 
====================== 
REPL means Read , Evaluate , Print , Loop 
To use Node REPL , just type node in the command line 

Using the console 
================= 
Accept input from the command line 
=================================== 
You can make a node.js CLI program interactive using the readline module
